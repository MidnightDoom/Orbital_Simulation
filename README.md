### This Project is a Work in Progress
I hope this project will eventually become a realistic 2d space combat simulator, 
based on The Expanse and the [Shackleton Disaster](https://youtu.be/bct3MwkxE0Y?si=TcT-rtbF8X4zdoFA), 
with orbital mechanics, a (somewhat) realistic scale, realistic weaponary, and perhaps even light lag. 
Currently, the simulation has code for ships but they still require implementation, and so is just
a 2d orbital simulation.
